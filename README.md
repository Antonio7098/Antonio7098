# Hi, I’m **Antonio Borge Rees** 👋

**Software Engineer · Agentic Systems · Frontier AI**

## Overview

I design and build **agent-orchestrated systems** with a focus on **observability, structure, and reliability**.

I’m less interested in flashy agent demos and more interested in the *systems around agents*:
how they coordinate, how they reason over data, how they fail, and how we can clearly understand what’s happening while they run.

I’m currently enrolled in the **Digital Futures – Frontier AI training programme**, focused on building practical, production-grade AI systems:

## Goals & Philosophy

My work is guided by a few core ideas:

* **If it isn’t observable, it didn’t happen**
* **Structure scales agents more than models**
* **Autonomy without debuggability is a liability**

As AI systems become more autonomous, understanding and controlling them matters more—not less. My goal is to push agent autonomy forward **without sacrificing clarity, safety, or control**.

## Project Highlights

### **Stageflow**

*Observable DAG orchestration for agent pipelines (Python)*

A framework for building **explicit, observable, parallel agent pipelines**.

Stageflow treats orchestration as a first-class problem: pipelines are DAGs, stages have clear contracts, and execution is observable by default.

**Best for:** multi-step LLM workflows, long-running automation, and systems where failures must be understood—not hidden.

* 📦 Install: `pip install stageflow-core`  
* 💻 Repo: https://github.com/Antonio7098/stageflow

### **Unified Content Protocol (UCP / UCM)**

*Graph-native, agent-first content representation*

UCP gives agents a **single, unified interface** to interact with content—whether it’s Markdown, JSON, HTML, databases, or code.

Content is represented as a **graph**, making it token-efficient, deterministic, and ideal for agent reasoning and traversal.

**Best for:** structural reasoning, safe autonomous edits, and long-context efficiency.

* 📦 Install: `pip install ucp-content`

### **Hivemind** *(in active development)*

*CLI-first orchestration and governance for agentic software development*

Hivemind is a **local-first orchestration system** for running multiple AI agents safely against real codebases.

It focuses on the *hard problems* of agentic development:
planning, parallel execution, scoped autonomy, verification, retries, diffs, commits, and full event-level observability.

Rather than treating agents as scripts or demos, Hivemind treats their work as **engineering activity** — structured, auditable, and recoverable.

**Best for:** parallel agent workflows, multi-repo changes, long-running autonomy, and systems where *failure must be explainable*.

* ⚠️ Status: early-stage, architecture-first development  
* 💻 Repo: https://github.com/Antonio7098/hivemind

### **24-Hour Testers**

*Autonomous reliability testing loop*

An always-on agent system that continuously tests a defined system, writes findings, generates reports, and creates backlog items—without manual triggering.

**Best for:** reliability engineering, long-running autonomy, and real-world agent operations.

* 💻 Repo: https://github.com/Antonio7098/24-hour-testers

---

### **Learning Sprints**

*Agent-guided framework for deep technical learning*

A structured way for agents to act as **mentors**, not tutorials—guiding investigation, implementation, feedback, and adaptive questioning.

**Best for:** deep understanding, professional habits, and skill synthesis.

* 💻 Repo: https://github.com/Antonio7098/learning-sprints

## Direction

All of these projects share a single goal:

> **Build better systems around agents—systems that scale autonomy without collapsing into opacity.**
